PulpDist - Filtered Mirroring with Pulp
=======================================

PulpDist is a set of Pulp_ plugins and an associated Django_ application that
together allow a network of Pulp_ servers to be used as a filtered mirroring
network with robust access control mechanisms.

The project is still in an alpha state, so there are quite a few rough edges,
not only in the code and documentation, but also in the development
infrastructure around the project.
