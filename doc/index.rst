PulpDist - Filtered Mirroring with Pulp
=======================================

PulpDist is a set of Pulp_ plugins and an associated Django_ application that
together allow a network of Pulp_ servers to be used as a filtered mirroring
network with robust access control mechanisms.

The project is in a very early alpha state, so there are a *lot* of rough edges,
not only in the code and documentation, but also in the development
infrastructure around the project.
