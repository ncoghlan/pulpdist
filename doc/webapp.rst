PulpDist Web Application
========================

The PulpDist web application is a Django-based web service that can be set
up to monitor a network of Pulp servers.

Early iterations will focus purely on status monitoring, leaving
configuration tasks to command line scripting tools. Longer term,
some configuration tasks may be permitted through the web application
(there are many steps to be taken before that will be possible, such
as implementing a robust authorisation scheme).
