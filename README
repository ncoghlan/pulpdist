PulpDist aimed to be a tool for managing a network of Pulp servers as a secure, centrally coordinated, mirroring system.

The goal was to provide filtered mirroring with robust access control between globally distributed sites over bandwidth limited and potentially high latency WAN links.

However, it is no longer under actively development, and has been imported into GitHub solely due to its previous hosting service being closed down.
